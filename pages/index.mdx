# Gitcoin Endgame 2030

## Executive Summary

Welcome to the Gitcoin Endgame 2030 initiative.

This is the start of a more constructive dialogue about Gitcoin's vision, roadmap, & endgame.

By working backwards from what success looks like and also forwards from where Gitcoin is now, we will chart a course towards success by 2030.

## Three parts

The Endgame intiative has three primary components.
1. Consensus layer - Synthesized set of roadmaps or proposals that have been accepted by GTC governance.
2. Endgame is designed to be forkable.   If you don't like what you see, you can fork it and write your own. 
3. Starter proposals by Kevin Owocki & Kyle Weiss to propose to the consensus layer.

## How to navigate this resource.

You are at **endgame.work** - which is the consensus layer repository.  This repository contains
1. Overview - a detailed overview of how the fork rules work.
2. Accepted Proposals folder - a series of proposals that have been accepted by governance (currently empty)
3. All Proposals - links to endgame proposals that have not been accepted by governance.
