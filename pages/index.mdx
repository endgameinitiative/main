# Gitcoin Endgame 2030

## Executive Summary

Welcome to the Gitcoin Endgame 2030 initiative.

This is the start of a more constructive dialogue about Gitcoin's vision, roadmap, & endgame.

By working backwards from what success looks like and also forwards from where Gitcoin is now, we will chart a course towards success by 2030.

The Endgame intiiative has three primary components.
1. It is designed to be forkable.   If you don't like what is here, you can fork it and write your own. 
2. A consensus layer - Synthesized set of proposals that have been accepted by GTC governance.
3. A series of proposals by Kevin Owocki & Kyle Weiss to propose to the consensus layer.

## How to navigate this resource.

You are at **endgame.work** - which is the consensus layer repository.  This repository contains
1. Overview - how the fork rules work.
2. Accepted Proposals folder - a series of proposals that have been accepted by governance (currently empty)
3. Links - to endgame proposals that have not been accepted by governance.
