# Introduction

This is the endgame initiative.

The title 'Endgame' is a playful adaptation of the concept of an [endgame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame) in chess:

> In chess and other similar games, the endgame (or end game or ending) is the stage of the game after the middlegame. The endgame begins when few pieces are left on the board.

It is also a homage to [Makers endgame](https://endgame.makerdao.com/endgame/overview) [1](https://twitter.com/runekek/status/1688571159367823360), an articulation of the final state of MakerDAO:

> The Endgame Plan is a proposal to overhaul and improve the governance and tokenomics of the Maker Ecosystem. Its primary aim is for the ecosystem to reach a self-sustainable equilibrium called the Endgame State. In this state, the ecosystem is resilient, and the scope and complexity of Maker Core will no longer change.

The endgame initiative, within the context of Gitcoin, is a framework for articulating the development & evolution of Gitcoin into its final form.  At a high level, you can think of this resouce as a way of compiling thinking about Gitcoin's vision & strategy into one place. 

## What is the endgame initiative?

To discuss what the endgame is... Lets dive deeper into what this resource is.. and what it is NOT.

### What this resource is NOT

This resource is NOT a command & control style dictum of what Gitcoin's strategy is.  [A DAO has no CEO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852), and legitimacy at Gitcoin comes from [other places](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778).

As legitimacy at Gitcoin is determined by the GTC governance process, this resource does not seek to imbue one endgame for Gitcoin.   Instead, this is a set of resources that can be forked to stimulate, articulate, synthesize, discussion on a plurality of perspectives.

### OK, so what is it?

This resource is a place to articulate, debate & eventually form consensus around different visions of what Gitcoin's endgame is.

Different forks of this resource will serve different parts of this discussion.
1. The *opionated forks* are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy.
2. The *consensus perspective forks* are meant to distill synthesized strategy that can achieve legitimacy & thereby actually be followed.

Ideally the relationship between these branches will look something like the marketplace of ideas in Linux (another project with a plurality of forks that all exchange ideas, code, and strategy with each other).  Something like this:

```
                                    vision A1
                                   /         \
    vision A -> discussion & debate           \
  /                                            \ merge back to consensus fork
 /                                              \
---------------------------------------------------- consensus fork

```

but sometimes a vision will be created that does not get a reaction or get merged into the consensus fork.

```
    vision B -> discussion & debate -> no action taken by consensus fork
  /                                          
 /                                       
---------------------------------------------------- consensus fork

```

perhaps if we are super committed to evolving our strategy together, then multiple consensuses will start to merge & share ideas with each other.

```

---------------------------------------------------- CSDO consensus fork
              \
               \ idea exchange
                \
---------------------------------------------------- token holder consensus fork

```


as multiple consensuses compete in the marketplace of ideas, it will be useful to illuminate where there is profound disagreement in the path forward.

```

---------------------------------------------------- CSDO consensus fork
              x
               x disagreement
                x
---------------------------------------------------- token holder consensus fork

```


## How do you use this resource?

1. **Read**
2. **Discuss** - Use Github Issues, gov.gitcoin.co, or twitter, to debate anything you want.
3. **Propose** - You can propose your own strategic thinking, either [by forking this repo](https://github.com/owocki/endgame/tree/main) or in any format you choose.
4. **Repeat** until success.

## Resource structure 

The endgame repo takes into account two perspectives.

### 1. Owocki perspective 

Deeply opinionated & created by Kevin.   No consensus process has been followed to created this perspective, but the following research was done:
1. Interviews with Rune & Kain.
2. Close working process with Kyle + with Michael Kriak.
3. Watching all of the CSDO livestreams
4. Reading all of the gov forums.
5. Drawing on 6 years as a Gitcoin co-founder.
6. Drawing on some of the whisper network knowledge about Gitcoin that tends to come one's way when one is works in public.

The Owocki perspective version of this endgame doc:
1. are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy (but are not meant to be taken as gospel).
2. are focused on what's best for the DAO (not whats best for any one constituent-set)
3. are focused on finding the high leverage points, [the upward spirals](https://community.supermodular.xyz/t/upward-spirals/289), and the hard trade-offs well ahead of time & in good faith.

### 2. Consensus perspective.

A mostly empty repo (right now), but contains an fork & merge process to be followed by anyone create a consensus version of the endgame by different parties.  Anyone can provide their own view of Gitcoin's endgame.

### View other vision documents:

A list of different consensus perspective resources are available here:
1. [Owocki endgame](https://endgame-git-main-owocki.vercel.app/)
2. TODO - invite Kyle to write one to the extent that his view differs from any of the forks.
3. TODO - maintain a CSDO fork of this repo or some other type of vision doc.
