# All proposals

## 1. K2 (Kyle/Kevin) proposal 

https://k2.endgame.gitcoin.co/

Deeply opinionated & created by Kevin Owocki + Kyle Weiss.   The following research was done:
1. Interviews with Rune & Kain.
2. Close working process with Michael Kriak.
3. Watching all of the CSDO livestreams
4. Reading all of the gov forums.
5. Drawing on many years of synthesis of information available a Gitcoin co-founder.
6. Drawing on discussions on twitter or in Discords about Gitcoin.

The K2 perspective version of this endgame doc:
1. are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy (but are not meant to be taken as gospel).
2. are focused on what's best for the DAO (not whats best for any one constituent-set)
3. are focused on finding the high leverage points, [the upward spirals](https://community.supermodular.xyz/t/upward-spirals/289), and the hard trade-offs well ahead of time & in good faith.

To us, a good endgame plan is:
1. Values aligned
1. Maximizing the accomplishment of Gitcoins mission
1. Pragmatic/Do-able
1. Comprehensive - it seperates concerns & considers tradeoffs between them
1. Will create financial sustainability (ideally financial thriving)
1. Will mean ultimately decentralizing or ossifying Gitcoin.
1. Will be ratified by governance eventually
