- I just turned backup as a volunteer.  I’m just a guy.  I don’t get paid.  
- How do you manage the social power? Re-engage without redoing the decentralization.
- No one in the world is going to care about Gitcoin like you do.  They care about the outcome.  The impact you can have with that social power plus the caring.  What’s
- Just started a new re-enagegment.  I was traveling around a lot and partying, rhb.  Cleaned up.  Running, yoga, meditation.  Chilling out. 
- Team was doing a good job.  But fundamentals werent good.
- Returning to do a moonshot.
- I’m not touching governance stuff.
- Where is the ideal place fory ou to exist?  How do you create a role.
- Maybe some DAOs need a CEO.  how do you create that role that constrains the power + provides checks and balances? 
- 3 lenses; what do i feel good about?  What will get social capital? What legal risk?
- When alt-coin summer happens again, its attention.  Attention is extremely valuable.   Awareness of x fell down when u left.  Narrative is powerful.  You come back, there is a v2. Doesnt take much to get cutthrough.
- On sycophants - The community will tell you youre wrong.    But contributors wont.  Push consensus out further out to the community.  Communities will push back on founders, but contributors will follow leaders.
- Rune is much more upset the applecart than me.  Stani is kind of in that role. Robert Leshner too.   Its not that lonely really.. Not idiosyncratic.  Everyone is doing something at this time of the cycle.
- In the last bear market, the thing that kept SNX together was my stubbornness.  Its a death march but you just do it.  10 ppl in 2019, they started retiring sometime in 2021. We pushed fucking hard.  We were all in a room together. Remote org culture thing.  If we were remote first, I dont know if we would have made it through a bear market.  “I dont give a fuck about COVID, were doing this.”.  No remote.  Remote is a joke.  If you have a capacity to motivate people, dont forgo that capacity for flexibility. 
- On creating a “Gitcoin Endgame”.  Narrative is important.   Spartan Council, Endgame, Old Dictator Appears.   Whats the meme?
