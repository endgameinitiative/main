whatd i do.

1. fire the decision-maker who put gitcoin brand at risk by lending it to shell
1. announce a recommitment to og gitcoin values
1. add a new policy of only working w value-aligned sponsors
1. never mention it again except for minimums necessary to complete contract

just basically do something quick and clean to kill the public narrative, then wait like 5 days, and use whatever new thing needs to be announced to change the topic as best you can.
