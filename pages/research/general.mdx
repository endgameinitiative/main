# General


## Culture
- “Between passport, Allo, and GS, there’s just a lot of “not my job” energy.” - someone who relies on them
- another problem is the cultural habit of ignoring the problem.  sticking your head deep into something without looking around to see everyone on twitter has pitchforks out and are torching the gitcoin brand (if you do see it, meh - its not your problem).  its not looking out the window to see that GTC/ETH is down 95% (and other gov tokens are down 20%-60%) and putting 2 and 2 together that thats your livelihood (if you do see it, meh - its not your problem).  its not taking ownership or being agentic.
- “no solid web3 ethos/education for many within + no internal shared values”
- “quite some people turnover which erodes trust
need for more / real community engagement rather than top down marketing”
- “no real distinction in practice between what gitcoin the program, grants stack and the protocol stands for (causing pr disasters like the DEI thing)”
- "too much bureaucracy for a small organization"
- "You guys need an intervention"

## Leadership problems: 
- Kyle is a great people person/ops person but lacks vision + has a hard time rallying the troops.  People pushing back on PGN.  
- also stylistically, i know that kyle can sometimes seem dismissive.
“- lets retreat into 6 weeks of strategy research” is a defense mechanism that DAO workstreams developed to avoid having to get in the trenches and do the dirty work it takes to reach product market fit and unsink the ship.    this selfish (but politicallly optimal) was behaviour is optimised to give workstream leads a story to tell while they bide their time + get their shit together. 
- the fix i think is to commit to hit PMF come hell or high water.  and data for accountability EVERYWHERE.  id love to see marketing funnels for grants stack, allo, passport -  how big are the pipelines at each stage, and how long until they each hit PMF / get token utiltiy?  what would have to be true to hit it?  
- Keep falling into the “meta trap”.
- CSDO feels like “planning to plan” committee.
