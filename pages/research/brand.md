# House of Brands 

 the old brand was a branded house (gitcoin grants, gitcoin hackathons, gitcoin KERNEL). the new one is (Passport, Grants Stack, Allocation Protocol) 

but theyve not really successfully transitioned to the new brands yet (still transfering over the legitimacy)

these are the twitter accounts for the new brands
https://twitter.com/alloprotocol
https://twitter.com/grantsstack
https://twitter.com/gitcoinpassport
https://twitter.com/pgn_eth 

i kind of think given the recent scuffles lives with the Public Goods Funding workstream, maybe they should have their own twitter id and brand, and they just run on the protocol like everyone else 
ideally there are multiple PGF workstreams
