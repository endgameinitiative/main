#Q: What would you change if you had a magic wand

Honestly? Pretty simple stuff.

More emphasis on improving our products (UX especially), giving more importance to the Program, commitment to being a bridge to web3, and feeling more confident knowing MMM has capacity to properly handle things.

Other than this Shell deal, we've got UNICEF who wants to expand their partnership with us (call Wednesday), American Cancer Society dealing with paperwork, University of Southern California talking about wanting to use grants funding they got from Jann Tallin as a experiment in real time with students for QF, and started speaking to a16z last week about including QF with Grants Stack in Crypto Startup School

Program is the top of the funnel good will creator for us in a way that nothing else in web3 does. 

Things like matching estimates and just having a better user experience all around is a must to me.


Direct Grants - is it working?  Charmverse is beating it in market.
