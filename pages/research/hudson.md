#Hudson

My feedback was ignored:  Specifically on transparency about why and how decisions were made. With the DEI thing, the blog that everyone got mad about was missing some very important language that could have better made a separation between Gitcoin and the judges and the round. In this case I can't even figure out who signed off on this and there isn't a dashboard or set of documents or anything that define who owns the twitter, how does "Gitcoin" get into a brand deal, now that it happened can Kyle talk publicly about how shell was trying to control everything?

The other thing I somewhat touched on is accountability. This all seems like a blended smoothie of decentralization attempts and DAO things that produce a lack of accountability. I have 0 idea who I should even talk to in order to say "You messed up on this one and here is why". On the Daphne thing, I thought it was Gitcoin, but Kyle and others made public and private statements to wash their hands clean of it since it was judging a round funded by others.
Also, since I know @Kyle will be seeing this. I am getting anecdotal DMs to me about Gitcoin's leadership and team being hostile to feedback about this and previous things. Someone needs to be a leader here.

anything else you think someone who is going to draft a gitcoin turnarround plan should konw?

Hearing familiar voices from Gitcoin's history, like you/Scott Moore/Simona etc. all come together with those from the new Gitcoin (Kyle, etc.) and have a plan that people can agree on would be valuable. I guess that depends on if it Kyle is going to stick around or what happens, but either way a written thing and maybe even a short video describing: 1) What Gitcoin was, 2) What Gitcoin is now, 3) Mission, 4) What to expect next
