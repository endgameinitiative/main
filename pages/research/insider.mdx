Gitcoin is a cabal of insiders. It is time for that to end. These people have all of the voting power, context, and access. They congratulate each other on the smallest things while the burn remains high, the brand gets tattered, and the products flail in market.

It was not meant to be this way. Gitcoin should be a decentralized political economy of subdaos working in their own most important things.

This will be predictably unpopular with insiders.  

It should be:
- subdaos with limited runway . Complexity to the edges
- ai to get context for outsiders. equal access for outsiders
- Subdaos can create dao matrix of skills
