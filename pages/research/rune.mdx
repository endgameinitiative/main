# Notes on Rune return to Maker
- He was the only one to see vision wide enough to articulate the endgame vision and what it would take to get there
- In the bear market there was no correlation between spend and output.
- DAOs are an intensely political game.  You have to solve for those power games by just connecting spend to output.
- Rune oscillated between hands off and hands on:
- From here: And Christensen, who was once keen to watch MakerDAO governance from afar, has thrown his enormous stash of MKR, the project’s governance token, behind each proposal.
- “He also disputed the claim that he had forced Endgame through MakerDAO.”
- Endgame:
	-  Phased approach
		- Phase 1: Rebrand, New Tokens, Farming
		- Phase 2: SubDAOs, RWA Collateral, & Tokenomics
		- PHase 3: AI
		- Phase 4 & 5 - Voting Rewards and a special purpose blockchain.
	- There might be something to learn about subDAOs as a way of scaling diff sub units.
		- Solves for ppl pulling in different directions.  They can go to subdaos that gree with them.
	- AI used to make information asymmetries go away.
	- Rebrand to make it simpler to understand.
	- Eventually voter rewards & a special purpose blcokchcain
	- Rune is actually the most aligned DAO member bc his interests are completely aligned with the project.  As opposed to the average DAO member that has the principle agent problem.
	- Why is MKR not valued high enough? “Crypto is an attention game
