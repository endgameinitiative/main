Learn as fast as possible.  Iterate as fast as possible.  Thats our sole focus.
We prioritize shipping products that try to be good experiences and improve the xp as much as possible.  Before building sophisticated on-chain components.

Make biggest improvement on UI before immunitbability.

Hypercerts: We want to put onus on projectsg to measure impact.   Hypercerts leaves it to impact evaluator.

On mission/intents, more teams building useful things.   Subtraction mindset means less from us.
