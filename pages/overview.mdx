# Introduction

This is the endgame initiative.

The title 'Endgame' is a playful adaptation of the concept of an [endgame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame) in chess:

> In chess and other similar games, the endgame (or end game or ending) is the stage of the game after the middlegame. The endgame begins when few pieces are left on the board.

It is also a homage to [Makers endgame](https://endgame.makerdao.com/endgame/overview) [1](https://twitter.com/runekek/status/1688571159367823360), an articulation of the final state of MakerDAO:

> The Endgame Plan is a proposal to overhaul and improve the governance and tokenomics of the Maker Ecosystem. Its primary aim is for the ecosystem to reach a self-sustainable equilibrium called the Endgame State. In this state, the ecosystem is resilient, and the scope and complexity of Maker Core will no longer change.

The endgame initiative, within the context of Gitcoin, is a framework for articulating the development & evolution of Gitcoin into its final form.  At a high level, you can think of this resouce as a way of compiling thinking about Gitcoin's vision & strategy into one place. 

## What is the endgame initiative?

To discuss what the endgame is... Lets dive deeper into what this resource is.. and what it is NOT.

### What this resource is NOT

This resource is NOT a command & control style dictum of what Gitcoin's strategy is.  [A DAO has no CEO](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/a-dao-has-no-ceo/9852), and legitimacy at Gitcoin comes from [other places](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/consent-of-the-governed-and-legitimacy-by-process-in-gitcoindao/9778).

As legitimacy at Gitcoin is determined by the GTC governance process, this resource does not seek to imbue one endgame for Gitcoin.   Instead, this is a set of resources that can be forked to stimulate, articulate, synthesize, discussion on a plurality of perspectives.

### OK, so what is it?

This resource is a place to articulate, debate & eventually form consensus around different visions of what Gitcoin's endgame is.

Different proposals will serve the discussion.
1. The *opionated proposals* are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy.
2. The *consensus proposals* are meant to distill synthesized strategy that can achieve legitimacy & thereby actually be followed.

Ideally the relationship between these branches will look something like the marketplace of ideas in Linux (another project with a plurality of forks that all exchange ideas, code, and strategy with each other).  

The main accepted/consensus proposal will be only for proposals that are put through the CSDO proposal process.


Itll look like this:

```
                                    vision A1
                                   /         \
    vision A -> discussion & debate           \
  /                                            \ CSDO approves merge back to consensus proposal
 /                                              \
---------------------------------------------------- consensus proposal

```

but sometimes a vision will be created that does not get a reaction or get merged into the consensus proposal.

```
    vision B -> discussion & debate -> no action taken by consensus proposal
  /                                          
 /                                       
---------------------------------------------------- consensus proposal

```

perhaps if we are super committed to evolving our strategy together, then multiple consensuses will start to merge & share ideas with each other.

```

---------------------------------------------------- proposal A
              \
               \ idea exchange
                \
---------------------------------------------------- proposal B

```


as multiple consensuses compete in the marketplace of ideas, it will be useful to illuminate where there is profound disagreement in the path forward.

```

---------------------------------------------------- proposal A
              x
               x disagreement
                x
---------------------------------------------------- proposal B

```
