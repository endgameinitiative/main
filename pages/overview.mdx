# Fork Process

This resource is a place to articulate, debate & eventually form consensus around different visions of what Gitcoin's endgame is.

Different proposals will serve the discussion.
1. The *opionated proposals* are meant to stimulate disussion about strategy.
2. The *consensus proposals* are meant to distill synthesized strategy that can achieve legitimacy & thereby actually be followed.

Ideally the relationship between these branches will look something like the marketplace of ideas in Linux (another project with a plurality of forks that all exchange ideas, code, and strategy with each other).  

The main accepted/consensus proposal will be only for proposals that are put through the CSDO proposal process.


Itll look like this:

```
                                    vision A1
                                   /         \
    vision A -> discussion & debate           \
  /                                            \ CSDO approves merge back to consensus proposal
 /                                              \
---------------------------------------------------- consensus proposal

```

but sometimes a vision will be created that does not get a reaction or get merged into the consensus proposal.

```
    vision B -> discussion & debate -> no action taken by consensus proposal
  /                                          
 /                                       
---------------------------------------------------- consensus proposal

```

perhaps if we are super committed to evolving our strategy together, then multiple consensuses will start to merge & share ideas with each other.

```

---------------------------------------------------- proposal A
              \
               \ idea exchange
                \
---------------------------------------------------- proposal B

```


as multiple consensuses compete in the marketplace of ideas, it will be useful to illuminate where there is profound disagreement in the path forward.

```

---------------------------------------------------- proposal A
              x
               x disagreement
                x
---------------------------------------------------- proposal B

```
