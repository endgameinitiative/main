# Idea Marketplace

The idea marketplace is a place to articulate, debate & eventually form consensus around different visions of what Gitcoin's endgame is.

Different proposals will serve the discussion.
1. Anyone can submit a *proposal*, and in doing so will stimulate disussion about strategy, roadmap, or vision.
2. The *accepted proposals* have been ratified by governance, and thereby have legitimacy to actually be followed.

## How does a proposal become an accepted proposal?

The accepted proposals will have gone through the [CSDO decision process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YKEeNdOI7zRjYRNvMt4WOHNh2qx51huY2Zg9Ew4SW_I/edit#heading=h.1ycx2voy7cu9) which is listed on the [CSDO notion page](https://gitcoin.notion.site/Gitcoin-Contributor-Hub-fcedc1413c9a4a27a3f4743fcb6a8b9b?p=a0ee3af2e8fe470992337f297d121b8f&pm=c).

## Building for a plurality of proposals

Ideally there will be a rich ecosystem of divergent proposals that will build upon one another, exchange ideas, and then converge towards a consensus.

Perhaps if we are super committed to evolving our strategy together, then multiple proposals will start to merge as people share ideas with each other.

```

---------------------------------------------------- proposal A
              \
               \ idea exchange
                \
---------------------------------------------------- proposal B

```


through this process, it will be useful to illuminate where there is profound disagreement in the path forward.

```

---------------------------------------------------- proposal A
              x
               x disagreement
                x
---------------------------------------------------- proposal B

```

As consensus emerges, the "Accepted Proposals" resource will grow.

```
                                    proposal A1
                                   /         \
    proposal A -> discussion & debate           \
  /                                            \ CSDO approves merge back to consensus proposal
 /                                              \
---------------------------------------------------- accepted proposal

```

but sometimes a proposal will be created that does not get a reaction or get merged into the consensus proposal.

```
    proposal B -> discussion & debate -> no merge
  /                                          
 /                                       
---------------------------------------------------- accepted proposal

```


## How do you engage in the marketplace of ideas?

1. **Read**
2. **Discuss** - Use Github Issues, gov.gitcoin.co, twitter, or any other medium you'd like, to debate.
3. **Propose** - You can propose your own strategic thinking, either [by forking this repo](https://github.com/endgameinitiative/main/tree/main) or in any format you choose.  To make a proposal, submit it via pull request to the [proposals page](https://endgame.gitcoin.co/all_proposals) of this repo.
4. **Repeat** until success.
